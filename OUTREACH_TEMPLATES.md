# TalkCRM Beta Outreach Templates

## LinkedIn Outreach Templates

### Template 1: The Pain-Point Hook (Best performer)

**Connection Request Note:**
```
Hey {FirstName}, saw you're leading sales at {Company}. Quick question - how much time do your reps spend updating Salesforce each week? Building something that might help.
```

**Follow-up Message (after connection):**
```
Thanks for connecting, {FirstName}!

I noticed {Company} uses Salesforce. Quick question - do your reps actually keep it updated?

Most sales leaders I talk to say their reps spend 5+ hours/week on CRM data entry. And half the time, it still doesn't get done.

I'm building TalkCRM - lets reps update Salesforce by voice in 30 seconds. Just call in and say "update the Acme deal to Closed Won" - done.

Looking for 10 beta users to try it free and give feedback. Interested?

### Template 2: The Mutual Problem (For sales leaders who post about CRM pain)

**Connection Request Note:**
```
{FirstName} - loved your post about {topic}. Fighting the same battle with CRM adoption. Would love to connect.
```

**Follow-up Message:**
```
Hey {FirstName},

Your post about {specific pain point} really resonated. We're solving this exact problem.

TalkCRM lets reps update Salesforce by voice - from their car, between meetings, wherever. No typing, no app, just call and talk.

Early users are seeing:
- 10x faster CRM updates (30 sec vs 5 min)
- 95%+ field completion rates
- Reps actually using Salesforce (finally)

We're looking for sales leaders to try the beta free. Would {Company} be a good fit?
```

### Template 3: The Advice Ask (Highest reply rate)

**Connection Request Note:**
```
{FirstName}, building a voice AI for Salesforce. Would love 10 min of your time for feedback - happy to share what we're learning about CRM adoption.
```

**Follow-up Message:**
```
Hey {FirstName}, thanks for connecting!

I'm building TalkCRM and would genuinely value your input.

Quick context: We let sales reps update Salesforce entirely by voice - call a number, say what you want to update, done.

I'd love 15 minutes to:
1. Show you what we've built
2. Get your honest feedback
3. Hear what would make this useful for your team

No pitch, just a conversation. If you hate it, tell me - that's valuable too.

Open to a quick call this week?
```

---

### Template 4: The Social Proof (After you have beta users)

**Message:**
```
Hey {FirstName},

Quick one - {Similar Company} just started using TalkCRM and their reps went from 40% CRM completion to 95% in the first week.

The difference? Voice updates. Their reps just call in after meetings and say "log a call with {Account}, discussed pricing, follow up Thursday."

Takes 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes. No typing, no forgetting.

We have 3 beta spots left this month. Worth a look for {Company}?
```

## Cold Email Templates

### Email 1: The Problem-Agitate-Solve (Primary template)

**Subject:** Quick question about {Company} sales team

```
Hi {FirstName},

Quick question - how much time do your reps spend updating Salesforce each week?

For most teams I talk to, it's 5+ hours. Per rep. Every week.

That's 286 hours per year that could be spent selling.

We built TalkCRM to fix this. Reps just call in and say "update the Acme deal to Closed Won" - done in 30 seconds, hands-free.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if this could help {Company}?

Best,
{Your Name}
```

### Email 2: The Stat Hook

**Subject:** 5.5 hours/week

```
Hi {FirstName},

Sales reps spend 5.5 hours per week on CRM data entry.

That's not selling. That's typing.

TalkCRM lets your reps update Salesforce by voice in 30 seconds:
- "Update the NovaSpark deal to $50K"
- "Create a task to call John tomorrow"
- "Log this call - discussed pricing, they need approval"

Done. No app, no typing, no laptop required.

Looking for 10 beta users at Salesforce-powered companies. Interested?

### Email 3: The Trigger-Based (Use when you see relevant LinkedIn activity)

**Subject:** Your post about CRM adoption

```
Hi {FirstName},

Saw your LinkedIn post about getting reps to actually use Salesforce.

Been there. It's brutal.

We're solving this with TalkCRM - voice-first CRM updates. Reps call a number, say what they want to update, and it's done.

No typing = no excuses.

Early results: Teams going from 40% to 95% field completion.

Would love to show you a quick demo and get your feedback. Free for beta users.

Worth 15 minutes?

### Email 4: The Value-First (No ask in first email)

**Subject:** Idea for {Company}

```
Hi {FirstName},

I've been researching how B2B sales teams handle CRM adoption, and I thought you might find this interesting:

The top-performing sales teams we've studied have one thing in common - they update their CRM in under 60 seconds.

The trick? They don't type. They talk.

Voice commands, AI transcription, automatic field population.

We've compiled our findings into a short guide on reducing CRM friction. Happy to share if useful.

Best,
{Your Name}
```

**Follow-up (3 days later):**
```
Hi {FirstName},

Following up - we're actually building this exact solution. It's called TalkCRM.

Reps call in, say "update the Acme deal to Closed Won," and Salesforce is updated in 30 seconds.

Currently looking for beta users to try it free. Would {Company} be interested?

{Your Name}
```

### Email 5: The Direct Sales Pitch (Use after warming)

**Subject:** {Company} <> TalkCRM

```
Hi {FirstName},

We help sales teams update Salesforce 10x faster using voice AI.

Results from early users:
- 30 seconds per update (vs 5 minutes)
- 95%+ CRM field completion
- Reps actually keeping pipeline current

How it works: Your reps call a number, say what they want to update ("mark the Acme deal as Closed Won"), and it's done. No typing, no app, no laptop.

We're offering free beta access to 10 more companies this month.

Would {Company} be a fit? Here's my calendar: [link]

## Follow-Up Sequence

### Follow-up 1 (3 days after initial email)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about {Company} sales team

```
Hi {FirstName},

Bumping this up - did you get a chance to see my note?

Happy to send a 2-minute video demo if that's easier than a call.

{Your Name}
```

---

### Follow-up 2 (5 days after follow-up 1)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about {Company} sales team

```
{FirstName},

Last try on this - I know you're busy.

One question: If your reps could update Salesforce in 30 seconds by voice (no typing), would that be valuable?

If yes, I'd love 15 minutes to show you TalkCRM.
If no, I'll stop bugging you :)

{Your Name}
```

---

### Follow-up 3 (7 days after follow-up 2 - The Breakup)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

```
Hi {FirstName},

I've reached out a few times about helping {Company}'s sales team update Salesforce faster.

I haven't heard back, which usually means one of three things:
1. Timing is bad (totally get it)
2. Not the right person (happy to be redirected)
3. Not interested (no hard feelings)

Let me know which, and I'll update my notes accordingly.

Either way, best of luck with {Company}!

## LinkedIn Post Templates (For Founder-Led Content)

### Post 1: The Pain Point Story
```
Sales reps spend 5.5 hours per week updating Salesforce.

That's 286 hours per year. Per rep.

For a 20-person team? That's 5,720 hours of typing instead of selling.

No wonder CRM adoption is a nightmare.

We're building TalkCRM to fix this.

Voice updates. 30 seconds. Done.

Looking for 10 beta users. Drop a comment or DM if interested.
```

### Post 2: The Hot Take
```
Hot take: The problem isn't Salesforce.

It's asking salespeople to be data entry clerks.

They're closers, not typists.

What if they could update their CRM by voice? From their car? In 30 seconds?

That's what we're building.

Reps talk. AI updates Salesforce.

Simple as that.
```

### Post 3: The Customer Story (After getting beta feedback)
```
Just got off a call with a sales leader.

His words: "My reps went from 40% CRM completion to 95% in one week."

The only thing that changed? They stopped typing.

TalkCRM lets them update Salesforce by voice.

- Call in after a meeting
- Say "Update the Acme deal to Closed Won, $50K"
- Done. 30 seconds.

That's it. That's the whole product.

Sometimes simple wins.
```
