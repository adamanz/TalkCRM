# TalkCRM Demo Script

## The Pitch (30 seconds)

> "Sales reps spend 70% of their time NOT selling - they're updating CRM, searching for info, logging calls. TalkCRM changes that. It's a voice-first AI assistant that lets reps interact with Salesforce completely hands-free - while driving, walking between meetings, or just when they don't want to type. Let me show you."

## Closing (30 seconds)

> "That's TalkCRM - voice-first CRM that works where you work. Whether you're driving, walking, or just don't want to type, your Salesforce is always one sentence away.

> We built this for the 70% of the day reps aren't at their desk. It's powered by Claude AI for natural language understanding, ElevenLabs for voice, and connects directly to your Salesforce org.

> Questions?"

---

## Handling Objections

**"What about accuracy?"**
> "The AI confirms before making changes. You heard it ask 'Is that right?' before updating the deal. No accidental updates."

**"What about security?"**
> "We use Salesforce OAuth - same security model as any connected app. Data stays in your Salesforce org."

**"Can it do [X]?"**
> "Right now it handles the core workflows: search, view, create, update, and log. We're adding more capabilities based on what reps actually need."

**"What if it doesn't understand?"**
> "It'll ask clarifying questions. If you say 'Update Acme' and there are 3 Acme accounts, it'll ask which one you mean."

## Pro Tips

1. **Speak naturally** - Say "find Acme" not "search for account named Acme Corporation"
2. **Let it finish** - Don't interrupt mid-response
3. **Use confirmation** - On updates, wait for the "Is that right?" confirmation
4. **Have backup** - If something doesn't work, just rephrase naturally
5. **End strong** - The "Closed Won" moment is your climax. Make it count!
