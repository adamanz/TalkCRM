## Sample Personalized Outreach

### For Cirrus Insight (Amy Green)

**LinkedIn Connection:**
```
Amy - fellow Salesforce productivity builder here. You're solving email/calendar sync, we're tackling CRM data entry via voice. Would love to connect and compare notes on adoption challenges.
```

**Email:**
```
Subject: Quick question about Cirrus Insight's sales team

Hi Amy,

Building in the Salesforce productivity space too - we're letting reps update CRM by voice (30 seconds vs 5 minutes typing).

Curious: do your own reps at Cirrus Insight struggle with keeping Salesforce updated? Or is that solved since you're building integrations all day?

Either way, would love 15 min to swap notes on CRM adoption. We're looking for beta users from companies that really understand the space.

Interested?

### For ConnectAndSell (Matt Mickey)

**LinkedIn Connection:**
```
Matt - we're building voice-first CRM updates for Salesforce. Your reps make hundreds of calls/day with ConnectAndSell... curious how they keep CRM updated after each one. Would love to connect.
```

**Email:**
```
Subject: Idea for ConnectAndSell reps

Hi Matt,

Your platform helps reps make 10x more calls. But how do they log all those calls in Salesforce?

We built TalkCRM - reps just call in after a dial session and say "log 12 calls, 3 connects, 1 meeting booked with Acme." Done in 30 seconds.

Could be a natural add-on for ConnectAndSell users. Worth a quick chat?
