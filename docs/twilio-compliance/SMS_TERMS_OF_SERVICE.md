> "Your TalkCRM verification code is: 123456. This code expires in 10 minutes."

- **Initial Setup:** 1-2 messages during account registration

- **Re-verification:** Occasional messages if re-verification is required for security purposes

**Your consent is:**
- Voluntary and not a condition of purchase
